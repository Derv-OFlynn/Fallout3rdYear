Computer Networks are generally comprised of numerous pieces of hardware and software.

Recall the previous attempt to 'model' how these components interconnect and interact with each other

Source -> Transmitter -> Transmission System -> Receiver -> Destination

Whilst the horizontal model is useful when looking at hardware components, the reality is it does not explain everything

With networking software, the layers of protocol software are organised into a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Stack</mark>

Each layer is said to offer <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">services</mark> to higher layers and to use the services offered by the lower layers

OSI model:
1. Application
2. Presentation
3. Session
4. Transport
5. Network
6. Data Link
7. Physical

The role of the Physical layer is to act as a medium and transmit pulses that represent 1s and 0s.

The Data Link layer interprets and deals with frames. Flow control, error control and error recovery.

Ethernet cables use Manchester encoding

Have to use an 802.11 protocol to communicate across a wireless mask

TCP/IP is a five layer model, more simplistic than OSI

Data works it's way down from the model.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Introduction, or what is knowledge?</mark>

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Knowledge</mark> is a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject or a domain.

Knowledge is also the sum of what is currently known, and apparently knowledge is power. Those who possess knowledge are called experts.

Anyone can be considered a <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">domain expert</mark> if he or she has deep knowledge (of both facts and rules) and strong practical experience in a particular domain. The area of the domain may be limited. In general, an expert is a skilful person who can do things other people cannot.

The human mental process is internal, and it is too complex to be represented as an algorithm.

However, most experts are capable of expressing their knowledge in the form of rules for problem solving.

### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Rules as a knowledge representation technique:</mark>

The term <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">rule</mark> in AI, which is the most commonly used type of knowledge representation, can be defined as an IF-THEN structure that relates given information or facts in the IF part to some action in the THEN part. A rule provides some description of how to solve a problem. Rules are relatively easy to create and understand.

Any rule consists of two parts: the IF part, called the <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">antecedent</mark> (<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">premise</mark> or <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">condition</mark>) and the THEN part called the <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">consequent</mark> (<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">conclusion</mark> or <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">action</mark>).

A rule can have multiple antecedents joined by the keywords AND (conjunction), OR (disjunction) or a combination of both.

The antecedent of a rule incorporates two parts: an object (linguistic object) and its value. The object and its value are linked by an operator.

The operator identifies the object and assigns the value. Operators such as is, are, is not, are not are used to assign a symbolic value to a linguistic object.

Expert systems can also use mathematical operators to define an object as numerical and assign it to the numerical value.

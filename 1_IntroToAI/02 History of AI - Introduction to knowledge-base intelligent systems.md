### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Intelligent machines, or what machines can do</mark>

Philosophers have been trying for over 2000 years to understand and resolve two Big Questions of the Universe: <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">How does a human mind work, and  Can non-humans have minds?</mark> These questions are still unanswered.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Intelligence</mark> is the ability to understand and learn things. 2 <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Intelligence</mark> is the ability to think and understand instead of doing things by instinct or automatically. - (Essential English Dictionary, Collins, London, 1990)

In order to think, someone or something has to have a brain, or an organ that enables someone or something to learn and understand things, to solve problems and to make decisions. So we can define intelligence as <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">the ability to learn and understand, to solve problems and to make decisions.</mark>

The goal of <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">artificial intelligence</mark> (AI) as a science is to make machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans.  Therefore, the answer to the question Can Machines Think? was vitally important to the discipline.

The answer is not a simple “Yes” or “ No ”.

 Some people are smarter in some ways than others. Sometimes we make very intelligent decisions but sometimes we also make very silly mistakes.  Some of us deal with complex mathematical and engineering problems but are moronic in philosophy and history.  Some people are good at making money, while others are better at spending it. As humans, we all have the ability to learn and understand, to solve problems and to make decisions; however, our abilities are not equal and lie in different areas. Therefore, we should expect that if machines can think, some of them might be smarter than others in some ways.

One of the most significant papers on machine intelligence, <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">“Computing Machinery and Intelligence”</mark>, was written by the British mathematician Alan Turing over fifty years ago. However, it still stands up well under the test of time, and the Turing’s approach remains universal.

He asked:<mark style="background: #69E7E4;"> Is there thought without experience? Is there mind without communication? Is there      language without living? Is there intelligence       without life?</mark> All these questions, as you can see, are just variations on the fundamental question of artificial intelligence, <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Can machines think?</mark>

Turing did not provide definitions of machines and thinking, he just avoided semantic arguments by inventing a game, the <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Turing Imitation Game</mark>.

The imitation game originally included two phases. In the first phase, the interrogator, a man and a woman are each placed in separate rooms.  The interrogator’s objective is to work out who is the man and who is the woman by questioning them. The man should attempt to deceive the interrogator that he is the woman, while the woman has to convince the interrogator that she is the woman.

In the second phase of the game, the man is replaced by a computer programmed to deceive the interrogator as the man did.  It would even be programmed to make mistakes and provide fuzzy answers in the way a human would.  If the computer can fool the interrogator as often as the man did, we may say this computer has passed the intelligent behaviour test

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">The Turing test has two remarkable qualities that make it really universal.</mark>
- By maintaining communication between the human and the machine via terminals, the test gives us an objective standard view on intelligence.
- The test itself is quite independent from the details  of the experiment. It can be conducted as a two-phase game, or even as a single-phase game when the interrogator needs to choose between the human and the machine from the beginning of the test.

Turing believed that by the end of the 20th century it would be possible to program a digital computer to play the imitation game. Although modern computers still cannot pass the Turing test, it provides a basis for the verification and validation  of knowledge-based systems.

<mark style="background: #69E7E4;">A program thought intelligent in some narrow area of expertise is evaluated by comparing its performance with the performance of a human expert.

To build an intelligent computer system, we have to capture, organise and use human expert knowledge in some narrow area of expertise.

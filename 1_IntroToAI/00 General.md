History & overview of AI
- Symbolic and Connectionist approaches. e.g., general problem solver (GPS) and neural network
- Early success with GPS, difficulty with “common sense” reasoning
- Emergence of Expert Systems, very useful in a narrow domain,
- AI winters.
- From 2000s onwards, deep neural networks became possible

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">What is Cloud Computing?</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">A customer-oriented definition:</mark>
- Anytime
- Anywhere
- Any device
- Any service

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">A business-oriented definition:</mark>
- Universal access
- Scalable services
- Collaborative
- New revenue models

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">A developer-oriented definition:</mark>
- Distributed Computing
- Scalable
- Access to 3rd party functionality
- Mobility

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">SaaS (ready to use):</mark>

- Most basic form of cloud computing
- No dev necessary for user
- No resources required form the user
- Software managed from a central location
- Software delivered in a “one to many” model
- Users not required to handle software upgrades and patches  
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow for integration between different pieces of software  
- Offer powerful tools right at web browser  
- Requires no installation  
- Requires no specific knowledge of user

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">SaaS examples:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Google Docs:</mark>  
- Productivity suite  
- Free to use (free Google Account required)  
- Share documents with others  
- Try it: docs.google.com

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Dropbox:</mark>  
- Online file storage  
- Automatic synchronization across computers  
- Sharing of files with other users  
- Web access + mobile access  
- Backup of data + restore (30 days)

Salesforce (CRM)  
- Sales cloud – automation of workflow  
- Service cloud – customer service  
- Chatter – collaboration tools  
- Jigsaw – customer contact database  
- Force.com – Salesforce platform for third party apps (PaaS)  
- Heroku – third party ruby apps (PaaS)
### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Platform as a Service (PaaS):</mark>

- "Provides developers with a proprietary APIs to make an application that will run in a specific environment"
- Can be any application you can think of  
- Is locked to the platform used for creation
- Examples: metaverse apps, PHP, Java, Python, C#

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Benefits of PaaS?</mark>
- Many services free to use
- Pay per use - good for users, not the best for providers
- Vendor lock-in difficult due to lack of standards. Containers can combat vendor lock-in.
- Why are companies offering PaaS environments?

- Key Benefit: DATA. "We're (IT companies) not Google's customers; we're Google's product that they sell to their customers" - Bruce Schneier

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Linking? Infrastructure as a Service:</mark>
- Real business innovation behind SaaS and PaaS is gathering data
- Most important asset cloud computing can provide is processing data
- Solution to processing vast amounts of data quickly can be found in IaaS

Infrastructure for:
- Developing
- Running
- Storing
. . . applications and data in cloud environments.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">IaaS:</mark>
- provides virtually limitless storage  
- provides virtually limitless computing power  
- potentially negates the need of having physical hardware at hand for doing so  
- provides numerous Linux, Unix and Windows environments to work in  
- provides variety of tools, services, SDKs and the like running on those OSs  
- Usually requires specific knowledge to use APIs for creating and managing the virtual OSs in the cloud infrastructure  
- therefore usually not user-friendly and simple to use

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">IaaS provider examples:</mark>
- AWS
- IBM Cloud
- DigitalOcean
- Microsoft Azure
- Linode
- Cloudera

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">"Cloud Computing" Model Abstraction:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Efficiency vs. Effectiveness:</mark> Efficient systems do not make wasteful use of system resources. Effectiveness is more focused on impact.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cloud Repatriation:</mark> Moving from the cloud back to local data centre.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">How do we do cloud development?</mark>

The development process remains the same...

But where we do these tasks may change..

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Deployment</mark> happens in the cloud.

The major players are:
1. Amazon 
2. Microsoft Azure
3. Google

Each has their own set of tools on offer.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Downsides:</mark>
- Security
- Lock-in
- Reliability
- Lack of control

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Upsides:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">A customer-oriented definition:</mark>
- Anytime
- Anywhere
- Any device
- Any service

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">A business-oriented definition:</mark>
- Universal access
- Scalable services
- Collaborative
- New revenue models

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">A developer-oriented definition:</mark>
- Distributed Computing
- Scalable
- Access to 3rd party functionality
- Mobility

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Why is it important?</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">SaaS (ready to use):</mark>
- Most basic form of cloud computing
- No dev necessary for user
- No resources required form the user
- Software managed from a central location
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">FINISH ^</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Platform as a Service (PaaS):</mark>
- Provides developers with a proprietary APIs to make an application that will run in a specific environment
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">FINISH ^</mark>
- Examples: metaverse apps, PHP, Java, Python, C#

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Benefits of PaaS?</mark>
- Many services free to use
- Pay per use - good for users, not the best for providers
- Vendor lock-in difficult due to lack of standards. Containers can combat vendor lock-in.
- Why are companies offering PaaS environments?

- Key Benefit: DATA. "We're (IT companies) not Google's customers; we're Google's product that they sell to their customers" - Bruce Schneier

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Linking? Infrastructure as a Service:</mark>
- Real business innovation behind SaaS and PaaS is gathering data
- Most important asset cloud computing can provide is processing data
- Solution to processing vast amounts of data quickly can be found in IaaS

Infrastructure for:
- Developing
- Running
- Storing
. . . applications and data in cloud environments.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">IaaS provider examples:</mark>
- AWS
- IBM Cloud
- DigitalOcean
- Microsoft Azure
- Linode
- Cloudera

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">"Cloud Computing" Model Abstraction:</mark>

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">INSERT DIAGRAM FROM SLIDES ^</mark>

Efficiency vs. Effectiveness. Efficient systems do not make wasteful use of system resources. Effectiveness is more focused on impact.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cloud Repatriation:</mark> Moving from the cloud back to local data centre.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">How do we do cloud development?</mark>

Development and Waterfall used as part

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">INSERT DIAGRAM FROM SLIDES ^</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Deployment</mark> happens in the cloud.

The major players are:
1. Amazon 
2. Microsoft Azure
3. Google

Each has their own set of tools on offer.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Downsides:</mark>
- Security
- Lock-in
- Reliability
- Lack of control

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Upsides:</mark>
- Scale and cost
- Encapsulated change management
- Next-generation architectures
- Choice and agility

n-tier architecture

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">CDN:</mark> Content Delivery Network

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Sharding</mark> is a concept where you have a relational database and you split it up based on parameters (e.g. for contacts storing A-F names and G-K name in separate databases to split up the load).

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">CAP Theorem:</mark> Consistency, Availability and Persistence Tolerance. Can only ever have 2/3.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Evolution of Distributed Systems:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Monolithic Systems (Single terms):</mark>
- Central processing (mainframe)
- Multiple access supported  by timesharing OSs
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">FINISH ^</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Client Server (Two tier):</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Multi-tier application:</mark>


### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Centralised System Characteristics:</mark>

- One component with non-autonomous parts
- Components shared by users all the time
- All resources accessible
- Software runs in a single process
- Single point of control 
- Single point of failure

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Distributed System Characteristics:</mark>

- Multiple autonomous components
- Components not shared by all users
- Resources may not be accessible
- Software runs in concurrent processes on different processors
- Multiple points of control
- Multiple points of failure

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Parallel Processing:</mark> Multiple processes running efficiently at the same time

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Concurrent Processing:</mark> The processes run one at a time but switch very very fast. Appears similarly to parallel processing.

Intel introduced multi-threading in ~2007

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Multicast:</mark> virtual group is created and a select number of computing nodes subscribes to a multicast address. The multicast address is virtual so everything subscribed to that address receives the packet.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Anycast:</mark> used mainly by CDNs. There is an IP address that can represent multiple nodes at the same time. Nodes at different points around the world, not just locally. Delivers to the nearest physical node to the centre.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Latency:</mark> The time it takes a packet to get from source to destination.

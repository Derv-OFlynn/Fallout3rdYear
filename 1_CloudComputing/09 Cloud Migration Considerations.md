### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cloud Migration – Key Questions</mark>  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">CIOs/IT Managers seeking to move to Cloud face several questions.</mark>
- How does Cloud fit into the organization’s requirements? (Financial advantage, convenience, etc. )
- Which are the applications suitable for Cloud?  
- How do I choose the Cloud Vendor?  
- Is the Cloud infrastructure capable of providing the required Quality of Service (QoS)?(Performance, availability, and security)  
- How will I address Change Management concerns?  
- What can Cloud provide? (Application, platform and infrastructure)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">How does Cloud fit to your requirements?</mark>  

Current infrastructure and requirements: Consider from application, network, and security perspectives.  

‘Risk vs. Convenience’ profile: Based on this profile, choose ‘Cloud model’ for your organization.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Choosing Applications for Public Cloud:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Proprietary and mission-critical application:</mark>  
- Proprietary applications provide competitive advantage  
- Organization perceives high risk to move this application to Cloud  
- These applications are typically maintained in-house  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Non-proprietary but mission-critical application:</mark>  
- Organization perceives high risk to move this application to Cloud  
- It can be moved to Cloud if the organization does not have adequate resources to maintain the application  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Non-proprietary and non-mission critical application:</mark>  
- Perceived as good candidate for Cloud, unless it is performance sensitive

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Selecting a Cloud Service Provider:</mark>  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Some key questions to ask before selecting a Cloud Service provider:</mark>  
- How long has the provider been providing the services?  
- How well does the provider meet the organization’s current and future requirements?  
- How easy is it to relinquish resources not in use and to reduce cost?  
- What tools does the provider offer (like virtual machine images) that would make it easy to move to another provider when required?  
- How easy is it to add/remove services?  
- Does the provider have good customer service support?  
- What happens when the provider upgrades their software? Is it forced on everyone? Can you upgrade on your own schedule?  
- Does the provider offer required security services?  
- Does the provider meet your legal and privacy requirements?

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Service Level Agreement (SLA):</mark>  

SLA is an agreement between the Cloud provider and the consumer that defines the quality and reliability of service  

SLA also defines the penalty for not meeting the agreement  

SLAs include factors such as network availability, performance, etc.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cloud Performance:</mark>  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Two key performance considerations:</mark>  
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Infrastructure performance:</mark> Saturation of Cloud infrastructure may impact performance. Right amount of resources should be allocated to the application to ensure performance  
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Network latency:</mark> Network latency typically arises due to large data sets being sent to and from the Cloud provider

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cloud Vendor Lock-in:</mark>

Cloud vendor (service provider) may lack open standards or use proprietary software/APIs.  

Rigid agreements prevent the consumer from moving without penalties.  

Cloud vendors may prevent a consumer from moving one service model to another (i.e. application built on a PaaS moving to an IaaS model).  

Application may require significant rework/redesign before deploying in different Cloud.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cloud Open Standards:</mark>
- Use proven and widely accepted technologies  
- Prevent lock-in issues  
- Open Virtual Machine Format (OVF) - an example of open standard

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cloud Adoption Phases:</mark>

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Phase 1 - Assessment:</mark>

The assessment phase involves consideration of various factors  

Besides Cloud migration considerations discussed earlier, other key assessments are:  
- Financial  
- Security and compliance  
- Technical  
- Issues with licensed products

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Financial Assessment:</mark>

Provides cost comparison of in-house vs. service provider (TCO and ROI)  

Requires cost consideration of the following elements:

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Security and Compliance Assessment:</mark>

Involves security advisor early in the process  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Enables organizations to:</mark>  
- Identify risk tolerance and security threats for an application  
- Understand regulatory/contractual obligations to store data in specific jurisdictions  
- Explore whether the Cloud vendor offers: Choice of selecting geographic location to store the data. Guarantee that data does not move unless organization decides to move 
- Explore options to retrieve all data back from the Cloud when required  
- Identify the download or delete option of data, if required  
- Identify the choice of encryption of data when in transit and at rest

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Technical Assessment:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Enables organizations to:</mark>  
- Identify whether Cloud service provider offers the required infrastructure  
- Identify whether an application is compatible with Cloud infrastructure  
- Identify the dependencies of an application on other components and services  
- Identify the component that must be local (on-premise) and components that can move to the Cloud  
- Identify the latency and bandwidth requirements  
- Estimate the effort required to migrate the application

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Assessment of License Issues:</mark>  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Use existing license:</mark>  
- Identify whether the organization can move its existing licensed software into the Cloud  
- Cloud providers have partnered with software vendors to permit the use of existing software license in the Cloud  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Use SaaS based Cloud service:</mark>  
- Some software vendors offer their software as a service apart from installable option 
- If a software vendor does not offer its software as a service, explore an equivalent offering by different Cloud vendor

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Phase 2: Proof of Concept</mark>  

Goal of this phase is to verify that an application runs as expected in the Cloud  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Proof of Concept enables organizations to:</mark>  
- Explore the capabilities of the Cloud  
- Explore the different business continuity and disaster recovery options offered by the Cloud vendor  
- Estimate the effort required to roll out the application  
- Identify applications that can be immediately moved after proof of concept

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Phase 3: Migration</mark>

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Phase 4: Optimisation</mark>

Test the application after migration is complete  

Understand the usage pattern and optimize resource consumption  

Relinquish idle resources

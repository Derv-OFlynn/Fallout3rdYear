- CA 2 week 12

CA is an in-lab assessment using Brightspace.

Broad, not deep.

Will go through CA in the lecture 2 weeks beforehand.

CA make-up in week 13. Will cover entire module so not in interest to miss CA 1/2.

Quiz feature, not multiple choice.

Only contact through email or in-person.

Required reading is examinable material.

Wait 72 hours after lecture to download notes in case slides are updated.

Attendance taken in lectures. Used to bump our grade if we fail.

Installing Linux from scratch in a VM for lab 2.

Last lecture before exam is devoted to going through exam.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">When and Where</mark>
- The CA1 takes place in-lab in-person during your normal scheduled lab session on Week 06 (The week beginning 21st October 2024). There is no possibility to do the CA1 remotely. There is only one sitting of the CA1 and this is it! Attendance is mandatory. There will be no resit opportunities for the CA1
- Student must attend the lab group session for which they are officially scheduled according the lab groups made available on Brightspace.
- The CA1 will begin at exactly 10 minutes past the hour when the lab session commences (for example: 3:10pm or 4:10pm).
- Every student must be logged-on to the Desktop PC and signed-in to Brightspace and ready to start the CA1 by 10 minutes past the start of the lab session.
    

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Format:</mark>
- The Cloud Computing CA1 is a closed-book individual-based in-lab Brightspace Quiz Assessment.
- There will be 32 questions in total. It will consist of a mixture of multiple choice questions and any other quiz type questions that Brightpspace allows.
- There will be no negative marking.
- It will have a total duration of 48 minutes. It will start on time and finish on time, regardless of whether students arrive late (or not at all). It will automatically submit the student quiz after 48 minutes if the student has not already submitted it. If a student arrives late or has problems logging on, that is on them - there is no opportunity to extend the quiz for the student. Students must leave the room after they have completed and submitted the CA1. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to ensure they have correctly submitted their CA1.
- The CA1 must be completed on the Desktop PCs in the lab. Only those student who cannot access a desktop because none are physically available must seek the explicit permission of the Teaching Assistant to sit the CA1 using their own laptop, before they are allowed to do so. However, please bring your laptops with you, in case no desktop PC is available.
- For the duration of the CA1, the Internet browser is the only application on the desktop/laptop permitted to be running or active. Within the browser application, only one tab may be open: for Brightspace. Students are only permitted to access Brightspace to sit the CA1, not to access lecture/lab materials or any other resources. Access to any and all other resources (physical or digital) are prohibited (students are not allowed to access previously created documents or files either in physical or digital form locally nor remotely).
- Toilet breaks are not permitted during the CA1, because the duration of the CA1 is only 48 minutes. The 10 minute delay before the beginning of the CA1 is explicitly to ensure every student has enough time to go to the toilet and then logon to the desktop PC in good time before sitting the CA1.
- All students must put their phones on silent and then place them away in their bags after successfully signing-in to Brightspace. No phones/pens/paper/etc are permitted on the desks. No USB keys/drives may be plugged into the desktops/laptops.
- No cheating/copying/plagiarism or AI assistance of any kind is permitted.

        - Full Student details (name, id, class group, lab group assignment).
        - Which CA they missed: CA1 or CA2.
        - The serious and significant reason why the missed the CA1 or CA2.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Sample Questions:</mark>



Some multiple choice.

## <mark style="background: #BABD00;">CA 2:</mark>

Similar to CA1. Some questions based on the labs.

"Please select the most correct answer" <- a lot of these questions

Do not get partial marks for partially correct answers

Hasn't decided on amount of questions
